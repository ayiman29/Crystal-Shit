## 📚 Based On Scrimba's React Course

This project was originally built as part of [Scrimba's Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course.

* The base layout and structure were taken from the travel journal project taught in the course.
* I modified and customized it to match my own creative (and chaotic) direction.
* All credit to the amazing Scrimba instructors for the foundation.
