Considering how many times he mentioned little girls in his songs, it’s honestly concerning. Luckily, he died in 1971 when his super-tight leather pants crushed his pelvic glands and strangled him to death."

Since the Jimothy client list never dropped, we still don’t know what he was really up to, but Robbie was the one doing the dirty work for him. The command for Robbie to act was always: “Do it, Robbie. Do it!” which would trigger his MKUltra programming and make him obey whatever his master wanted. Oh, and yeah, he played guitar."
